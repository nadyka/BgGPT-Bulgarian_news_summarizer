To accurately represent the described user interface and interactions in a Mermaid.js diagram, we need to focus on the key components and their interactions. Here's a revised diagram that includes the main page, sidebar, and the interactions between the functions based on your description:

```mermaid

    A[Main Page] --> B[Fetch Top 10 News Now Button];
    A --> C[Fetch 5 Most Popular News Now Button];
    A --> D[List of Top 10 News Articles];
    A --> E[Summary of Clicked Headline];
    A --> F[HTML and JSON Files for Top 10 News];
    A --> G[HTML and JSON Files for Long Summary];
    A --> H[HTML and JSON Files for 5 Most Popular Articles];
